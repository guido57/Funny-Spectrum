# InternetRadioI2S-PCM5102

This is an Internet Radio receiver based on ESP32 (D1 Mini) and PCM5102 I2S board.

### Overview
It is mostly forked from https://github.com/schreibfaul1/ESP32-audioI2S.

I added:

1) a local web server with two pages: 
- one to change the WIFI credentials 
- and the other one to set up to 5 different internet radio stations

2) a button to go to the next radio station
